# ChatGPT Clone Project

This project was initiated by FAC (Founders and Coders), an organization dedicated to training individuals in software and web development. Our team, consisting of myself, Fran, Ciaran, Nas, and Prince, was tasked with building a ChatGPT clone. We successfully accomplished this task.

However, recognizing the potential for further improvements and enhancements, I have decided to continue working on this project independently. Hence, I've forked the project to my own repository. Here's why:

1. **Natural Conclusion:** The project reached its conclusion among the team, but there is still room for growth and development,one that I am happy to undertake.
2. **Learning Opportunity:** Forking the project provides me with the opportunity to explore and utilize GitHub features such as forking, something I haven't previously used.
3. **Personalization:** By forking the project, I can tailor it to my specific needs and preferences without impacting the original team's work.
4. **Continuous Improvement:** I believe in the importance of iterative development and continuous improvement. Forking allows me to continue refining the project over time.
5. **Ownership:** Forking gives me ownership and control over the project, allowing me to make decisions and drive its direction independently.


### What I've Added to the Project:

1. **Stylish CSS:** Implemented CSS enhancements to improve the overall aesthetics of the application.
2. **Media Queries:** Added media queries for various screen sizes, ensuring responsiveness across devices.
3. **Security Key Concealment:** Implemented a feature to hide the security key for enhanced security.
4. **Chat Clearing Functionality:** Added the ability to clear the chat history for better user experience.
5. **Error Handling:** Incorporated visual feedback to notify users in case of errors, such as incorrect keys or failed message delivery, etc.
7. **Interactive Feedback:** Implemented a spinner to provide users with visual feedback, ensuring they are informed when actions are being processed on the page."

### Future Improvements:

1. **Accessibility:** Enhance screen readability and ensure accessibility for all users.
2. **Documentation:** Complete the README with comprehensive details on how the product works, its features, and a detailed description.
